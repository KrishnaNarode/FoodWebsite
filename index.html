                <p class="center">Maharashtrian cuisine is as diverse as Indian cuisine as a whole. Each region offers a distinct flavour, contributing to making the state a potpourri of varied foods. From missal pav and vada pav to kothimbir vadi and puran poli, one can never run out of options for a hearty meal. And just like all regional cuisines, traditional Marathi-style meal comes in a large thali. In fact, there is a specific way of plating up the thaali in this part of the country. On the top, you'll find salt and lemon. Side dishes like chutneys, snacks and salads are placed on the left side. Dry vegetables and curries and dals find their place on the right side. Rice occupies the centre stage and breads right below at the bottom.

                <p>The neatly-set Maharashtrian thali is a feast not just for our taste buds but also for our eyes.</p>
